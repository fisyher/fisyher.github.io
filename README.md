DTX Charter is a web page that reads in [DTXMania](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmaniaxg-verk) sim files selected by users and draws Drum / Guitar chart as high-resolution images. To save the chart images, right-click on the image and select "Save as...". Supported sim files are .dtx and .gda files 

## Background
DTXMania is a software simulator for the Drummania/GuitarFreaks game. Players can create custom song charts known as sim files and load them into DTXMania to play.
Back in the pre-720p video days, static chart images of songs in the official game are more commonly shared by fans than videos for reference purposes (e.g. [XGPager](http://www.xgpager.com/)). The static chart images created by fans are usually low-quality and most probably created by hand.
DTX Charter allow players who prefer reading a song chart via the old-school static chart image, create their own chart images from available DTXMania sim files.
