# DTX Charter
DTX Charter is a web page that reads in [DTXMania](https://osdn.net/projects/dtxmaniaxg-verk) sim files selected by users and draws Drum / Guitar chart as high-resolution images. To save the chart images, right-click on the image and select "Save as...". Supported sim files are .dtx and .gda files 

## Background
DTXMania is a software simulator for the Drummania/GuitarFreaks game. Players can create custom song charts known as sim files and load them into DTXMania to play.
Back in the pre-720p video days, static chart images of songs in the official game are more commonly shared by fans than videos for reference purposes (e.g. XGPager). The static chart images created by fans are usually low-quality and most probably created by hand (unverified).
DTX Charter aims to let fans who prefer reading a song chart via the old-school static chart image, create their own chart images from available DTXMania sim files.
